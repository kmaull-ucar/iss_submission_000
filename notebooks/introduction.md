## Background

Air quality is crucial for human health. Poor air quality, characterized by high levels of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, can lead to various respiratory illnesses including asthma and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) {cite}`noauthor_air_nodate`.

Exposure to certain pollutants can also trigger heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases. For instance, sulfur dioxide, a common pollutant, can cause severe lung irritation and damage, leading to chronic bronchitis and emphysema {cite}`ghorani-azam_effects_2016`.

Moreover, air pollution can increase the risk of premature death. It has been linked to several types of cancer, including lung cancer, and can also contribute to other serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease  {cite}`noauthor_tn_nodate`.

Therefore, maintaining good air quality is essential for the overall well-being of individuals and communities. This can be achieved through measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and implementing clean transportation systems {cite}`noauthor_tn_nodate`.
