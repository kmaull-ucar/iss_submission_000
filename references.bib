	abstract = {MoreAir is a low-cost and agile urban air pollution monitoring system. This paper describes the methodology used in the development of this system along with some preliminary data analysis results. A key feature of MoreAir is its innovative sensor deployment strategy which is based on mobile and nomadic sensors as well as on medical data collected at a children’s hospital, used to identify urban areas of high prevalence of respiratory diseases. Another key feature is the use of machine learning to perform prediction. In this paper, Moroccan cities are taken as case studies. Using the agile deployment strategy of MoreAir, it is shown that in many Moroccan neighborhoods, road traffic has a smaller impact on the concentrations of particulate matters (PM) than other sources, such as public baths, public ovens, open-air street food vendors and thrift shops. A geographical information system has been developed to provide real-time information to the citizens about the air quality in different neighborhoods and thus raise awareness about urban pollution.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensors (LCS) are becoming popular for air quality monitoring (AQM). They promise high spatial and temporal resolutions at low-cost. In addition, citizen science applications such as personal exposure monitoring can be implemented effortlessly. However, the reliability of the data is questionable due to various error sources involved in the LCS measurement. Furthermore, sensor performance drift over time is another issue. Hence, the adoption of LCS by regulatory agencies is still evolving. Several studies have been conducted to improve the performance of low-cost sensors. This article summarizes the existing studies on the state-of-the-art of LCS for AQM. We conceptualize a step by step procedure to establish a sustainable AQM setup with LCS that can produce reliable data. The selection of sensors, calibration and evaluation, hardware setup, evaluation metrics and inferences, and end user-specific applications are various stages in the LCS-based AQM setup we propose. We present a critical analysis at every step of the AQM setup to obtain reliable data from the low-cost measurement. Finally, we conclude this study with future scope to improve the availability of air quality data.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has the potential to contribute to sustainable cities, life on land, and climate action. Specifically, data-driven AI models can analyze large, interconnected databases to develop joint environmental actions. Air quality plays a pivotal role in both climate action and the development of sustainable cities, but developing countries face challenges due to insufficient monitoring stations and limited access to air quality data sets. This study builds upon the MoreAir project, which established a low-cost air pollution monitoring system and provided the first air quality data set from Morocco. We first exploit and delve into the details of the obtained dataset. Subsequently, we conduct a multi-level comparison of data-driven forecasting models, specifically focusing on short-term forecasting of Particulate Matter concentrations. Four forecasting frameworks are explored, using different combinations of exogenous data and spatio-temporal information. Our findings highlight that Machine Learning models, particularly LightGBM and CatBoost, outperform other models. Overall, our study demonstrates that the inclusion of the spatial dimension along with the diverse exogenous features enhances the models’ predictive performance, and provides valuable insights.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a major concern of new civilized world, which has a serious toxicological impact on human health and the environment. It has a number of different emission sources, but motor vehicles and industrial processes contribute the major part of air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, six major air pollutants include particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Long and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact on human including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, and long-term chronic diseases such as cancer. Several reports have revealed the direct association between exposure to the poor air quality and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution is considered as the major environmental risk factor in the incidence and progression of some diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, ventricular hypertrophy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychological complications, autism, retinopathy, fetal growth, and low birth weight. In this review article, we aimed to discuss toxicology of major air pollutants, sources of emission, and their impact on human health. We have also proposed practical measures to reduce air pollution in Iran.},
